 * AnchorManager - Manages anchor peer persistence for eclipse attack resistance

 * - Select high-quality anchor peers from current connections
 * - Save anchor peers to disk for restart recovery
 * - Load anchor addresses from disk (passive - returns addresses, doesn't initiate connections)
 *
 * Bitcoin Core uses anchors to mitigate eclipse attacks by remembering
 * a few high-quality peers from previous sessions. On restart, NetworkManager
 * reconnects to these anchors before accepting other connections, making it
 * harder for an attacker to isolate the node.
 *
 * Design: AnchorManager is passive - it manages address selection and persistence,
 * but NetworkManager is responsible for initiating connections to anchor addresses.
